Fon looks similar to Kyoya Hibari and Alaude, though his hairstyle differs from theirs in that he has a long braid. A doll resembling him would later be given to I-Pin by Ryohei. Early in the series, he wore a disguise that comprised purple clothes and dark glasses with large, round lenses. He is otherwise usually dressed in red.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>.
