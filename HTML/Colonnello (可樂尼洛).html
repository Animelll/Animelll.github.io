The Rifle is a weapon capable of shooting powerful bullets. Colonnello uses this as his weapon of choice and has been shown to be able to emit his Rain Flame from his Rifle, enhancing its destructive capability. This rifle can also scan and view the power level of a person when pointed at a person. Additionally, Colonnello appears to have a different kind of rifle that he used while his Arcobaleno Curse was temporarily removed that was larger and shinier, which he used to perform his Maximum Rifle attack that from one attack, splits into multiple shots to hit multiple targets. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>.
