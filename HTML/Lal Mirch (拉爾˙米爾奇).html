Lal Mirch sports dark blue hair, dark red-brown eyes and tan skin. Given her appearance and name (meaning red spice in Indian) it could be considered that her character was meant to have Indian origins. She has a distinctive 'flame' scar on her right cheek that was supposed to be a burn but was later said to be an after effects of using the pacifier too much. She is first seen in infant form wearing combat gear, a crimson cape and an infrared visor. Lal also dons her corrupt Arcobaleno pacifier on her chest like Reborn. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>.
