As head of the combat forces of the Carcassa Famiglia, he wears a full leather outfit and a large white motorcycle helmet; a similar uniform is worn by his subordinates. The helmet is equipped with a green visor and decorated with a picture of his animal partner, a giant armored octopus named Oodako whose tentacles follow his hand and finger movements. In both his Arcobaleno and adult forms, he wears eyeliner and has a teardrop-shaped tattoo under his left eye. He also wears lipstick. By his own admission, his adult form is a "pretty-boy hottie" and "seven heads tall". <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>.
