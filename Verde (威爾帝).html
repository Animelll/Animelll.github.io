Verde is the holder of the Lightning Arcobaleno Pacifier, and his animal partner appears to be a crocodile or alligator named Keiman. Verde was briefly mentioned by Reborn as the person who sent assassins to kill Tsuna. Apparently, Verde has knowledge about camouflage and invisibility, so he gave his subordinates Optical Camouflage suits that are able to make them invisible to everyone but children. Verde believed that he should be able to see his subordinates in case they ever tried to sneak up on him in an attempt to kill him. Verde is also one of the three scientists who developed the Box Weapons in the Future, where he is said to be dead.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>.
